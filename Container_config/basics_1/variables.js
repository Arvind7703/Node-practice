// Variables - var,let and const

var name = "Arvind"; //Value can be re-declared
let age = 20; // Value can not be re-declred
const dob = "7/7/2003"; // value can not be changed and should intialize at the time of making varible

// example

var a = 5;
var a = 10;
//  console.log(a); // output 10 cs we can re-declare

let b = "Arvind";
let c;// we can also leave it undeclared value we can re assign it later
c = "Vishwakarma"
// let b = "change";  it'll trow an error as it can not be re-declared

// const d; it'll throw an error we can not leave const varibel with undeclared value we have to intialize
const d = "Pass"; // value of const varable can not be changed as it's a constant
